COSC428: Computer Vision Project
================================

This was created to investigate whether orientation data (i.e. the gravity vector obtained from a combination of accelerometer and gyroscope data) is useful when attempting to detect ground and floor planes in images.

Build Instructions
------------------

First, you must download a copy of the [OpenCV](http://opencv.org) iOS framework and place it at `COSC428/opencv2.framework`. This project was built against [version 3.2 of the framework](https://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/opencv-ios/3.2.0/opencv-3.2.0-ios-framework.zip/download). Once this is complete, Xcode (version 8.3 or later) should be able to build the project as normal.
